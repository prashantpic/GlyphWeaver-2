# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
Glyph Weaver Leaderboard Service


---

# 2. Description
This microservice repository is exclusively focused on providing a robust and scalable leaderboard system. Its responsibilities include ingesting score submissions from the game client, performing comprehensive server-side validation to ensure the integrity of scores, and running sophisticated cheat detection algorithms to identify and flag anomalous or impossible submissions. It calculates player rankings for various scopes—global, friends-only, and time-limited events—and implements consistent tie-breaking rules based on secondary metrics like completion time. To ensure high performance, it heavily utilizes caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed leaderboard data. It provides API endpoints for the client to fetch leaderboard views and for players to see their own rank. All score submissions and moderation actions are logged for auditability.
