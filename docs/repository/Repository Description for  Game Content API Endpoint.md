# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
Game Content API Endpoint


---

# 2. Description
Manages game content that may be dynamically fetched or registered with the backend. Its primary responsibility is to allow the client to register the generation parameters (seed, etc.) of a procedurally generated level instance, receiving a unique ID in return. This allows the backend to reproduce the level for verification, cheat detection, or customer support purposes. It may also serve definitions for hand-crafted levels or other game data if needed.
