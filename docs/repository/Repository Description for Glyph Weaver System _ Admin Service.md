# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
Glyph Weaver System & Admin Service


---

# 2. Description
This microservice repository functions as the administrative backbone of the game. It provides a secure, role-based API for internal staff (support, ops, design) to manage the live game environment. Its key responsibility is managing the game's remote configuration, allowing for real-time updates to feature flags, event parameters, store item availability, and other game settings without a full deployment. It also exposes administrative functions to support customer service, such as endpoints for handling player data access or deletion requests in compliance with privacy laws. Furthermore, it serves as the central point for system-wide health checks, providing a consolidated health status endpoint that the API Gateway and external monitoring tools can poll to verify the availability of all critical backend services. All administrative actions are strictly audited.
