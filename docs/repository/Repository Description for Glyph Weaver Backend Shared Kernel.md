# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
Glyph Weaver Backend Shared Kernel


---

# 2. Description
This repository is a foundational shared library (published as a private NPM package) used by all other backend microservices. It implements the Shared Kernel pattern to ensure consistency, reduce code duplication, and accelerate development. It contains a suite of common modules, including standardized TypeScript interfaces and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for all cross-service communication, ensuring strict data contracts. It provides base Mongoose schema definitions with common fields like timestamps. The library also includes centralized utility functions for logging (a pre-configured Winston instance), custom error handling classes, database connection management, and other reusable helper functions. By depending on this single package, every backend service operates on a consistent and robust foundation, simplifying maintenance and inter-service integration.
