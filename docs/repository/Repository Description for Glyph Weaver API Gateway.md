# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
Glyph Weaver API Gateway


---

# 2. Description
This repository serves as the master API coordinator, implementing the API Gateway pattern. It is the single, public-facing entry point for all requests originating from the game client. Its primary role is to orchestrate and route these requests to the appropriate internal backend microservices (e.g., a request to '/api/scores' is routed to the Leaderboard Service, while '/api/inventory' goes to the Player Service). This repository centralizes critical cross-cutting concerns, providing a unified location for JWT authentication and authorization enforcement, global rate limiting, and CORS policy management. It simplifies the client by providing a stable and consistent API surface, even as the internal microservices evolve or are refactored. The gateway is also responsible for aggregating responses from multiple services if needed and provides a single point for comprehensive request and response logging for debugging and security monitoring.
