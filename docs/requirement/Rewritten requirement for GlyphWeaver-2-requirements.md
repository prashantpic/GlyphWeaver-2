**Glyph Weaver - Enhanced Software Requirements Specification**

**0. System Transition and Implementation Strategy**
    _   **0.1 Implementation Approach**
        *   **Initial Game Launch:** The initial deployment of "Glyph Weaver" to production environments (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and backend services) *will* follow a "Big Bang" approach, where all core features and Zone 1-4 hand-crafted levels are released simultaneously. Pre-launch activities *will* include final QA, store submission and approval, and backend infrastructure readiness.
        *   **Major Updates and New Features:** Subsequent major updates (e.g., new zones, significant new mechanics, major backend changes) *may* employ a phased rollout strategy (e.g., regional staged rollout, A/B testing for specific features if applicable) to monitor stability and gather feedback before full global release. This *will* be decided on a per-update basis.
        *   **Backend Deployments:** Backend updates *will* be deployed via the CI/CD pipeline, aiming for zero-downtime deployments where possible.
    _   **0.2 Data Migration Strategy**
        *   **Initial Deployment:** For the initial launch, data migration primarily involves the deployment of pre-defined game configurations, including hand-crafted level data, initial store item definitions, and default game settings to the production database.
        *   **Player Data (Version Updates):** As stated in Section 11, if the save data schema changes between game versions, a robust data migration path *must* be implemented and thoroughly tested to upgrade older player save data (both local and cloud-synced) to the new format without data loss. This includes versioning of save data and scripts to handle transformations. Validation procedures *must* be in place to verify data integrity post-migration.
        *   **Backend Data:** Migration scripts and processes *must* be developed for any schema changes in the backend database (MongoDB), ensuring data integrity and minimal service disruption. These migrations *will* be part of the CI/CD deployment process.
    _   **0.3 Training Requirements**
        *   **Player Training:**
            *   Interactive tutorials for new game mechanics, as detailed in Section 5 (User Interactions).
            *   Clear in-game explanations for new features, obstacles, or glyph types introduced in updates.
        *   **Internal Staff Training:**
            *   **Support Team:** Comprehensive training on game mechanics, common player issues, IAP processes (including refund/dispute handling in conjunction with platform providers), use of administrative tools for player support (e.g., checking purchase history, addressing data privacy requests), and communication protocols.
            *   **Development & Operations Team:** Training on the full technology stack, CI/CD pipeline, deployment procedures, monitoring and alerting tools, incident response protocols, security best practices, and disaster recovery procedures.
            *   **QA Team:** Training on testing methodologies specific to the game, use of testing tools, and understanding of all game mechanics and business rules to ensure thorough test coverage.
    _   **0.4 Cutover Plan (Initial Launch and Major Updates)**
        *   **Pre-Launch/Pre-Update Checklist:** A detailed checklist *must* be completed, covering: final QA sign-off, successful build compilation for all target platforms, backend deployment and verification, store submission assets readiness, approval from app stores (for initial launch or client updates), and communication plan readiness.
        *   **Launch/Update Sequence:** A defined sequence of actions, including: final data backups, backend service deployment/update, smoke testing of backend services, phased client release (if applicable) or monitoring app store propagation, and post-launch monitoring activation.
        *   **Go/No-Go Criteria:** Clear, measurable criteria (e.g., critical bug count, performance benchmarks, successful completion of critical path tests) *must* be met before proceeding with the launch/update.
        *   **Post-Launch/Post-Update Monitoring Plan:** Intensive monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) (see Section 13) for a defined period (e.g., 24-72 hours) post-launch/update to quickly identify and address any emergent issues.
        *   **Rollback Plan:**
            *   **Backend Services:** A documented procedure for rolling back backend services to a previous stable version in case of critical issues. This *should* be automated as part of the CI/CD pipeline where feasible.
            *   **Client Application:** Client rollbacks are managed via app store submissions. For critical issues, features *may* be remotely disabled via a configuration system if designed for such.
        *   **Communication Plan:** Internal communication plan for the launch/update process. External communication plan for players in case of significant issues or planned downtime.
    _   **0.5 Legacy System Integration and Decommissioning**
        *   **Initial Launch:** Not applicable as "Glyph Weaver" is a new game.
        *   **Future Development:** If future versions involve significant backend overhauls or API changes:
            *   A transition period *may* be required where both old and new systems/APIs run in parallel.
            *   Clear plans for migrating users and data to the new system *must* be developed.
            *   A formal decommissioning plan for old services/APIs *must* be established, including user notification and support for a reasonable period.

**1. Detailed Level Design**
Structure and Progression
The game organizes levels into zones, with the first 50 levels hand-crafted to introduce mechanics systematically, followed by procedurally generated levels for infinite replayability. Each zone escalates complexity:
_	Zone 1 (Levels 1_10): 3x3 to 4x4 grids, 2_3 glyph types, path puzzles, no obstacles, no time/move limits, solvable in 3_5 minutes.
_	Zone 2 (Levels 11_20): 4x4 to 5x5 grids, 3_4 glyph types, path and sequence puzzles, blocker stones, optional time limits, 5_10 minutes.
_	Zone 3 (Levels 21_30): 5x5 to 6x6 grids, 4_5 glyph types, path, sequence, color match puzzles, blocker stones and shifting tiles, time/move limits, 5_10 minutes.
_	Zone 4+ (Levels 31+): 6x6+ grids, 5+ glyph types, all puzzle types and combinations, all obstacles, strict limits, 10_20 minutes.
_   Level Data: Each level definition *will* include: Level ID, Zone ID, Grid Dimensions, Glyph Types and Positions, Obstacle Types and Positions, Puzzle Type(s), Time/Move Limits (if any), Pre-defined Solution Path(s) (for hand-crafted levels, for testing and hints) or Generated Solution Path(s) (for procedurally generated levels), Shifting Tile Patterns (if applicable). The seed and parameters used for procedurally generated levels *must* be logged to allow reproduction.

Hand-Crafted Levels
Hand-crafted levels ensure a smooth learning curve. Examples include:
_	Level 1 (3x3 Grid):
	o	Objective: Connect two pairs (A-A, B-B) without overlapping paths.
	o	Layout:\nA . B\n. . .\nB . A
	o	Solution: A(1,1) to A(3,3) via (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2)-(3,2)-(3,3); B(1,3) to B(3,1) via (1,3)-(2,3)-(2,1)-(3,1). Paths use distinct cells, teaching basic path drawing.
_	Level 11 (4x4 Grid, Sequence Puzzle):
	o	Objective: Connect glyphs 1_4 in order, avoiding blocker stones.
	o	Layout:\n1 . . 2\n. X . .\n. . X .\n3 . . 4\n(X = blocker stone)
	o	Solution: Connect 1(1,1) to 2(1,4) to 3(4,1) to 4(4,4), navigating around X cells, introducing sequence mechanics and obstacles.
_	Level 21 (5x5 Grid, Color Match):
	o	Objective: Connect red glyphs, avoid blue, with shifting tiles that move after each action.
	o	Layout: Dynamic, requiring players to adapt to tile shifts.
	o	Solution: Plan paths anticipating tile movements, ensuring red glyphs are connected.

Procedural Generation
For levels beyond 50, a template-based algorithm generates puzzles:
_	Parameters:
	o	Grid Size: Scales from 3x3 to 10x10+ based on zone.
	o	Glyph Types: 2_10, including special types like mirror or linked glyphs.
	o	Obstacles: 0_5, increasing in number and complexity (e.g., more shifting tiles in higher zones).
_	Solvability: The generator *must* verify at least one valid solution using constraint satisfaction algorithms [e.g., backtracking search, pathfinding algorithms like A* adapted for puzzle constraints]. The generator *must* also include checks to prevent unsolvable or trivially easy puzzles, ensuring a minimum and maximum complexity threshold per zone. Generated level data, including its solution, seed, and generation parameters, *must* be stored or reproducible for verification and hint purposes.
_	Variety: Randomizes glyph placement and obstacle positions within templates to ensure diverse challenges.
_	Difficulty Curve within Procedurally Generated Levels: The procedural generation algorithm *must* ensure a gradual increase in difficulty within its generated levels, corresponding to the player's progression (e.g., by zone or by number of levels completed), by adjusting parameters like grid size, glyph complexity, obstacle density, and strictness of limits.

Difficulty Scaling
_	Early Levels: Simple objectives, no limits, quick to solve.
_	Mid-Game: Introduce combined puzzle types and optional limits, requiring strategic planning.
_	Late-Game: Complex combinations, strict limits, and dynamic obstacles, demanding analytical skills.

**2. Gameplay Design**
Core Gameplay
Players swipe through grid cells to draw paths connecting matching glyphs, with paths occupying cells that cannot be shared by other paths. Key mechanics include:
_	Path Drawing: Paths start at one glyph, end at its match, and pass only through empty cells, snapping to the grid for precision.
_	Non-Overlapping Paths: Each cell can be occupied by only one path, preventing overlaps.
_	Feedback: Valid connections trigger glowing animations; invalid moves (e.g., overlapping paths) produce red flashes and error sounds.
_	Error Handling: In addition to specific feedback mechanisms, the game *must* gracefully handle unexpected errors or states, providing informative messages to the user where appropriate and preventing crashes. Client-side errors that cannot be recovered *should* prompt a restart or return to the main menu. Server communication failures *must* be handled with appropriate retries or user notifications. Logs of unhandled exceptions *must* be sent to the crash reporting service.

Puzzle Types
The game supports multiple puzzle types, combinable for added complexity:
_	Path Puzzles: Connect pairs of identical glyphs (e.g., two _A_s) without overlapping paths. Example: On a 4x4 grid, connect three pairs without shared cells.
_	Sequence Puzzles: Connect glyphs in a specific order (e.g., 1 to 5), indicated by numbers or visual cues.
_	Color Match Puzzles: Connect glyphs of the same color or alternate colors along paths, requiring color differentiation.
_	Constraint Puzzles: Connect glyphs while adhering to restrictions, such as avoiding blocked cells or specific paths.
_	Combinations: Example: A level requiring sequence and color match, where players connect glyphs 1_5 in order, but only if red, avoiding obstacles.

Obstacles and Special Glyphs
_	Blocker Stones: Impassable cells that prevent path traversal, forcing alternative routes.
_	Shifting Tiles: Cells that change position after a move, requiring players to anticipate dynamic changes. Shifting tiles will move predictably according to predefined patterns for each level or zone (e.g., all shifting tiles on the grid move one cell clockwise, or swap with an adjacent tile based on a set rule). The shifting pattern for a level *must* be deterministic and predictable for the player within that level instance. They cannot shift into cells currently occupied by a fixed obstacle (like a Blocker Stone), a glyph's starting/ending point if that would make the puzzle unsolvable, or any cell currently occupied by a segment of another active path. If a path segment occupies a shifting tile, the path segment moves with the tile. The game *will* ensure that shifts do not inherently break an active path in a way that makes completion impossible without an undo, or *will* provide clear visual cues if a path segment is severed or invalidated by a shift. Puzzle generation algorithms *will* also prevent scenarios where a valid solution requires a shifting tile to move a path segment into an already occupied cell in a way that violates these rules.
_	Catalysts: Randomly appearing glyphs that players must interact with to earn bonuses. While typically requiring a tap within 2_3 seconds, adding time pressure for standard play, accessibility options *will* be provided. These options *will* include settings to significantly increase or disable this timer, or allow Catalysts to be activated via alternative input methods (e.g., selecting the Catalyst cell and confirming activation) without a strict time limit for users who require it.
_	Special Glyphs: The game may introduce other special glyphs in later zones or procedurally generated levels, with clearly defined mechanics:
    o	**Mirror Glyphs:** These glyphs come in pairs (e.g., M1-M1, M2-M2). When drawing a path from one mirror glyph, an identical, mirrored path (symmetrical across a defined axis of the grid or relative to the grid center) *must* be drawable from its counterpart without overlapping other paths or the primary path. Both paths *must* be completed simultaneously or as part of a single \"connect\" action.
    o	**Linked Glyphs:** A set of two or more different glyphs (e.g., L1 and L2) that are \"linked.\" Connecting one glyph of the linked set (e.g., L1 to its match) might trigger an effect on the other linked glyphs (e.g., L2 activates, changes color, or must be connected next). Alternatively, a path might need to pass through all linked glyphs in a specific sub-sequence before reaching the final matching glyph. Their specific behavior *will* be introduced via tutorials.

Win/Lose Conditions
_	Win: All glyphs are connected within constraints (e.g., no overlapping, correct sequence).
_	Lose: Failure to complete within time/move limits or invalid moves (e.g., overlapping paths).

**3. Scoring Design**
Scoring System
The scoring system encourages efficient and skillful play:
_	Base Score: 1000 points per level, providing a consistent foundation.
_	Time Bonus: Calculated as (maximum time - time taken) _ 10 points, rewarding speed.
_	Move Bonus: (Maximum moves - moves used) _ 50 points, applicable in move-limited levels, rewarding efficiency.
_	Penalties: -100 points per hint, discouraging overuse while allowing assistance.
_	Total Score: Base + Time Bonus + Move Bonus + Bonuses - Penalties.
_	Star Ratings:
Stars	Score Threshold
3	>= 90% of max
2	>= 70% of max
1	>= 50% of max
_   Maximum Possible Score: Each level *must* have a defined maximum possible score, calculated based on achieving all bonuses (including no hints, all catalysts, speed bonus if applicable) and optimal time/moves. This value is used for star rating calculation.

Example Calculation
For a level with a 60-second limit, 10-move limit, completed in 30 seconds with 5 moves, no hints, and all catalysts collected:
_	Base: 1000 points
_	Time Bonus: (60 - 30) _ 10 = 300 points
_	Move Bonus: (10 - 5) _ 50 = 250 points
_	Bonuses: +200 (no hints) + 100 (all catalysts) = 300 points
_	Total: 1000 + 300 + 250 + 300 = 1850 points
_	Star Rating: Depends on maximum possible score; if max is 2000, 1850/2000 = 92.5%, earning 3 stars.

**4. Bonus Score Design**
Current Bonuses
_	No Hints Bonus: +200 points for completing a level without using hints, rewarding independent problem-solving.
_	All Catalysts Bonus: +100 points for successfully tapping all catalysts within their 2_3-second windows (or successfully interacting with them via accessibility options), encouraging quick reactions or engagement.

Proposed Additional Bonuses
To enhance engagement, the game *shall* implement:
_	Speed Bonus: Additional points for completing a level significantly under the time limit (e.g., +50 points if completed in half the allotted time). This bonus *must* be clearly defined and consistently applied.
_	Combo Bonus: Points for connecting all glyphs in a single continuous path, if feasible within puzzle constraints and level design. This bonus *must* be clearly defined and applicable only to levels designed to support it.

**5. User Interactions**
Input Mechanics
The game is designed for intuitive touch interaction:
_	Path Drawing: Players swipe through cells to draw paths, with snapping to grid cells for precision. Invalid moves (e.g., overlapping paths or passing through non-target glyphs) trigger visual (red flash) and audio (error sound) feedback.
_	Catalyst Interaction: Players interact with catalysts to earn bonuses. For standard play, this involves tapping them within 2_3 seconds, with success granting +100 points and failure resulting in the catalyst disappearing without penalty. For users with relevant accessibility settings enabled, the interaction may involve an extended or disabled timer, or activation via alternative input methods as described in Section 2.
_	Undo: Limited to 3 per level, allowing players to revert the last move, useful for correcting mistakes. The number of undos available can be a consumable IAP item.
_	Hints: Highlight a correct path segment, costing -100 points, balancing accessibility with challenge. The number of hints available can be a consumable IAP item.
_	Menu Navigation: Touch-based, with clear options for main menu (New Game, Continue, Leaderboards, Settings, Store), level selection, and settings adjustments.

Tutorials
Interactive tutorials guide players through each new mechanic, such as swiping to connect glyphs or tapping catalysts. Tutorials are skippable for experienced players, ensuring accessibility without redundancy. Tutorial completion status *will* be tracked per player.

**6. Front End Design**

	o	Connected glyphs glow or disappear, enhancing satisfaction.
	o	Level completion triggers celebratory effects, like sparkling animations.
_	Color Palette: Designed for accessibility, with distinct patterns for colorblind modes to differentiate glyphs and paths. Further accessibility considerations *will* include:
    o	Adjustable text size for UI elements and in-game instructions.
    o	Support for screen readers (e.g., VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android) for navigating menus and understanding game state. This includes proper labeling of UI elements.
    o	Sufficiently large touch targets for all interactive elements, adhering to platform accessibility guidelines (e.g., minimum 44x44 points on iOS, 48x48dp on Android).
    o	An option for reduced motion to minimize animations that could be problematic for some users.
    o	Consideration for alternative input mechanisms or assists if swipe gestures prove difficult for users with motor impairments, such as a tap-to-select cell-by-cell path building option. These features *will* be reviewed against established guidelines like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for mobile.

Optional rewarded video ads for in-game currency or temporary boosts may also be considered. All IAP offerings *must* comply with platform guidelines (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and clearly communicate value to the player.
_   Store Content: The in-game Store, accessible from the main menu, *will* offer:
    o   Consumable Items:
        *   Hint Packs: Bundles of hints (e.g., 5 hints, 20 hints). Item ID, name, description, price, quantity.
        *   Undo Packs: Bundles of additional undo actions (e.g., 10 undos). Item ID, name, description, price, quantity.
    o   Non-Consumable Items:
        *   Ad Removal (if ads are implemented): A one-time purchase to permanently remove all interstitial or banner advertisements. Item ID, name, description, price.
        *   Cosmetic Packs: Optional visual customizations for glyphs, path effects, or UI themes. Item ID, name, description, price, preview assets.
        *   Level Packs (Future): Potential for future hand-crafted premium level packs. Item ID, name, description, price, associated level IDs.
_   Pricing: Price points *will* be set according to platform guidelines and market standards, offering a range of options. Prices *will* be localized for different regions/currencies.
_   Virtual Currency: A soft virtual currency (e.g., \"Glyph Orbs\") may be earned through gameplay (e.g., completing levels with high stars, daily rewards) and can be used to purchase consumable items or cosmetics. This currency may also be purchasable with real money.
    o   Virtual Currency Data: Player balance *must* be securely stored and synchronized (see Section 11).
_   Purchase Validation: All purchases *will* be handled securely through native platform (iOS App Store, Google Play Store) payment gateways and validated server-side (see Section 12).

**9. Leaderboards**
_   Scope and Types:
    o   Global Leaderboards: For overall high scores on specific challenging levels or per zone.
    o   Friends Leaderboards: Integrated with platform services (Game Center, Google Play Games) to display scores of the player's friends.
    o   Time-Limited Event Leaderboards: For special challenge levels or events.
_   Information Displayed:
    o   Player Rank.
    o   Player Name/Alias (sourced from platform service or a user-chosen in-game name, subject to moderation, privacy settings, and platform terms of service).
    o   Player Score.
    o   Optionally, player avatar if provided by platform services.
    o   Timestamp of score submission.
_   Refresh Mechanism: Leaderboards *will* aim for near real-time updates upon score submission. A manual refresh option *will* be available. Client-side caching *may* be used to reduce load, with clear indication of last refresh time.
_   Ranking Rules: Primarily based on total score. Tie-breaking rules *will* use secondary metrics like faster completion time or fewer moves, applied consistently.
_   Player Identity: Player identity for leaderboards *will* primarily use aliases from integrated platform services. Players *will* have options for anonymity or using a guest name if not signed in or if they prefer, as per privacy settings and in compliance with platform policies.
_   Data Handling: Leaderboard data *will* be managed to handle a large number of entries efficiently. Utilize appropriate MongoDB indexing strategies (e.g., compound indexes on LevelID/ZoneID, score, and timestamp fields) for efficient querying and sorting of leaderboard data. Implement caching strategies (e.g., using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed leaderboards (e.g., top N scores, player's rank vicinity) to reduce database load and improve response times.
_   Scalability: The leaderboard system *must* be designed to scale to support a large number of scores (e.g., millions) and players without degradation in performance. Consider data archiving or pruning strategies for very old or inactive leaderboard data if necessary, in line with data retention policies.
_   Auditability: Score submissions to leaderboards *must* be logged on the server, including player ID, score, level ID, and timestamp, for auditing and cheat detection purposes (see Section 12).

**10. Platform Services Integration**
_   General: The game *will* integrate with Apple's Game Center for iOS and Google Play Games Services for Android. All integrations *must* comply with the respective platform's terms of service and implementation guidelines.
_   Authentication: Players *will* be offered to sign in to their respective platform service accounts. Gameplay *will* be possible without signing in, but features like cloud saves and friend leaderboards *will* require it. Authentication status *will* be clearly indicated to the player.
_   Leaderboards: Scores *will* be submitted to the native platform leaderboards using their respective APIs, in addition to any custom backend leaderboards. Leaderboard IDs *will* be configured in the platform developer consoles.
_   Achievements: The game *will* include achievements (e.g., \"Complete Zone 1,\" \"Solve a level without hints,\" \"Tap 50 Catalysts\"). These *will* be integrated with Game Center and Google Play Games Services. Achievement definitions (ID, name, description, unlock criteria, points/icon) *will* be managed. Player achievement status *will* be synchronized.
_   Cloud Saves: Player progress synchronization *will* leverage these platform services (see Section 11).

**11. Player Data Management**
_   Cloud Save Functionality: To prevent data loss and allow synchronization across multiple devices per platform.
_   Mechanism:
    o   Primary Method: Integration with platform-specific services: iCloud Key-Value Storage or CloudKit for iOS, and Google Play Games Saved Games for Android.
    o   Data Synchronized:
        *   Player Profile: User ID, chosen alias (if any), preferences (audio, accessibility settings).
        *   Level Progress: Completed levels, star ratings per level, high scores per level.
        *   Unlocked Content: Unlocked zones, cosmetic items.
        *   IAP Status: Status of non-consumable IAPs.
        *   Game State: Tutorial completion flags, current zone/level.
        *   Saved data *must* be structured (e.g., JSON or a compact binary format like Protocol Buffers), versioned to handle updates to the data schema, and serialized efficiently to ensure compatibility across game updates and minimize storage/bandwidth.
    o   Consumable Items and Virtual Currency:
        *   For players utilizing an optional, robustly implemented custom game backend account system, consumable items (e.g., Hint Packs, Undo Packs) and virtual currency balances (e.g., \"Glyph Orbs\") *will* be server-authoritative and synchronized through this account.
        *   For players not using the custom backend account system, or if such a system is not fully implemented for this purpose, consumable items and virtual currency balances *will* be managed via local saves and synchronized through platform-specific cloud save services (iCloud, Google Play Games Saved Games), accepting the client-authoritative nature for these items in such cases. Purchase validation (Section 12) *will* still be server-side.
_   Conflict Resolution: A strategy *will* be implemented, typically favoring the most recent save based on a reliable timestamp (UTC), or prompting the user to choose between local and cloud save data in case of significant conflict (e.g., if timestamps are too close or data diverges significantly). The conflict resolution logic *must* be carefully designed to prevent data loss and provide a clear user experience. A backup of the overwritten data *should* be temporarily kept if possible.
_   Local Backup: A local save *will* always be maintained on the device, serving as the primary data source if cloud services are unavailable or disabled by the user. Local saves *must* be robust against corruption, potentially using atomic write operations or backup copies (e.g., save to a temporary file, then rename).
_   Data Migration: If the save data schema changes between game versions, a clear data migration path *must* be implemented to upgrade older save data to the new format without data loss, as detailed in Section 0.2.

**12. Security, Data Privacy, and Compliance**
_   **12.1 General Security**
    _   Secure Communication: All communication between the game client and backend services involving sensitive data *will* use HTTPS/TLS encryption (TLS 1.2 or higher). API keys, secrets, and other sensitive configuration data *must* be securely managed (e.g., using environment variables, secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) and not hardcoded in the client application.
    _   Security Audits: Regular security reviews (e.g., code reviews focusing on security vulnerabilities, vulnerability scanning) *should* be conducted for both client and backend systems, especially before major releases or updates involving sensitive data handling. Penetration testing *may* be considered based on risk assessment and budget.
    _   Security Incident Response Plan: A documented plan *must* be in place for identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security incidents. This plan *will* include roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
_   **12.2 Leaderboard Integrity**
    o   Server-side validation for all score submissions *must* be implemented to detect anomalies (e.g., impossibly high scores based on level parameters, unusual progression speed, invalid move sequences) and prevent obvious cheating. Critical game logic related to scoring *will* be designed to be as resilient as possible to client-side manipulation. Implement API rate limiting and request validation (e.g., checksums of game state) on score submission endpoints to mitigate abuse and DDoS attempts.
    o   Suspicious activities *must* be logged for review. Accounts demonstrating persistent, verifiable cheating *may* be excluded from leaderboards or subject to other actions as per the Terms of Service.
_   **12.3 In-App Purchase (IAP) Validation**
    o   All IAP receipts *will* be validated with the respective platform provider's servers (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) via a secure server-to-server call from the game's backend before purchased content is granted. Store transaction IDs, validation status, and item granted *must* be stored server-side to prevent replay attacks, ensure atomicity, and assist with customer support.
_   **12.4 Data Privacy Strategy and Regulatory Compliance**
    o   **Privacy Policy:** A clear, comprehensive, and easily accessible privacy policy *will* be provided (e.g., in-app link, website). This policy *will* detail:
        *   Data collected (specific data elements, purpose of collection, legal basis for processing).
        *   Use, storage, and security measures for collected data.
        *   Data retention policies.
        *   User rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection, restriction of processing).

        *   Contact information for privacy-related inquiries.
    o   **PII Handling:** Collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) *will* be minimized to what is strictly necessary for game functionality and service provision. Any PII (e.g., platform service IDs for leaderboards/cloud save, email if a separate account system is used, IP address for service delivery and security) *will* be handled securely, encrypted where appropriate (e.g., at rest using AES-256 or similar, and in transit using HTTPS/TLS), and with user consent where required. Data *will* be classified (e.g., PII, sensitive, non-sensitive).
    o   **User Consent:** Mechanisms for obtaining explicit user consent for data collection and processing (especially for analytics, personalized ads if any, and PII not strictly necessary for core game functionality) *will* be implemented, with clear opt-out options where applicable (e.g., via in-game settings). Consent records *will* be maintained.
    o   **Data Access, Rectification, and Deletion:** Procedures *will* be in place for users to request access to, rectification of, or deletion of their personal data. These procedures *must* be documented, communicated to users, and handled within regulatory timeframes.
    o   **Child Privacy:** The game *will* comply with child privacy regulations such as COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - US), GDPR-K (EU), and other applicable regional laws. If the game is targeted at children under the relevant age of consent (e.g., 13 in the US, 13-16 in EU depending on member state), appropriate age gating and parental consent mechanisms *must* be implemented for collection of PII. If not targeted at children, measures *should* be taken to prevent unintentional collection of PII from users identified as children.
    o   **Applicable Regulations:** The game's data handling practices *must* strive for compliance with relevant data protection and privacy laws, including but not limited to:
        *   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - European Union).

        *   Other regional or national privacy laws as applicable based on user demographics.
_   **12.5 Legal and Industry Standards**
    o   **Terms of Service (ToS) / End User License Agreement (EULA):** A ToS/EULA *must* be provided and accessible to users (e.g., in-app link, website). This agreement *will* outline: user conduct expectations, intellectual property rights, disclaimers of warranty, limitations of liability, dispute resolution, and termination clauses. Acceptance of ToS/EULA *will* be required for service use.
    o   **Intellectual Property (IP):** All game assets (art, music, sound effects, source code, story elements) *must* be original creations or properly licensed. The game name, logos, and distinctive visual elements *should* be considered for trademark protection.
    o   **Third-Party Services:** Compliance with the terms of service of all integrated third-party SDKs, APIs, and platforms (e.g., Unity, analytics providers, cloud hosting, platform services like Game Center/Google Play Games) *is mandatory*.
    o   **Platform Guidelines:** The game *must* adhere to all applicable guidelines and policies of the distribution platforms (e.g., Apple App Store Review Guidelines, Google Play Developer Program Policies).
_   **12.6 Auditability (Security and Privacy)**
    o   Key system events and data access related to security and privacy *must* be logged. This includes:
        *   Authentication attempts (success/failure).
        *   Changes to sensitive player data (e.g., email if custom accounts are used).
        *   IAP validation processes (success/failure, transaction details).
        *   Access to PII by administrative tools (including admin ID, timestamp, action performed).
        *   User requests for data access/deletion and actions taken.
        *   Significant security configuration changes.
    o   These logs *must* be securely stored, protected from tampering, and retained according to policy and regulatory requirements. Access to these logs *must* be restricted to authorized personnel.

**13. Analytics and Monitoring**
_   User Behavior Tracking:
    o   An analytics SDK (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Unity Analytics, GameAnalytics, or a custom solution) *will* be integrated. Data collection *will* be subject to user consent and privacy policy.
    o   Tracked Events: Level progression (starts, completions, fails, retries, time per attempt), hint/undo usage per level, IAP funnel events (store impressions, item views, purchase attempts, successful purchases), feature engagement (catalysts tapped/missed, settings changes), zone progression, tutorial completion/skips, session length, DAU/MAU, player retention cohorts. Event data *must* include relevant parameters (e.g., level ID, item ID).
    o   Purpose: Data *will* be used for game balancing, difficulty curve adjustment, UI/UX improvements, feature popularity assessment, understanding player churn points, and evaluating monetization effectiveness, all in accordance with the privacy policy.
_   Performance Monitoring:
    o   Client-side performance metrics (FPS, memory usage, CPU load, battery impact, load times, network latency for API calls) *will* be monitored using integrated SDK tools or platform-specific tools (e.g., Xcode Instruments, Android Profiler). These metrics *can* be reported as custom events to the analytics service, anonymized where possible.
    o   Backend Performance Monitoring: Implement Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana stack, or cloud-native solutions like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring) for backend services to track request latency, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network), and database performance (query times, connection pooling).
_   Error and Crash Reporting:
    o   A crash reporting tool (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Bugsnag, Sentry, Unity Cloud Diagnostics) *will* be integrated for both iOS and Android for proactive issue identification, logging (including stack traces and device context), and resolution. Backend services *will* also log errors comprehensively.
_   Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization: Analytics data *will* be aggregated and anonymized/pseudonymized wherever possible and appropriate to protect individual player privacy, especially before being used for broader analysis or reporting. User IDs for analytics *should* be distinct from PII or platform IDs if possible, or pseudonymized according to best practices.
_   Monitoring and Alerting Needs:
    o   System Health Indicators: Key metrics for client (crash rates, ANR rates, load times) and backend (API error rates, latency, server resource utilization, database connection health, queue lengths for async tasks).
    o   Thresholds: Define critical and warning thresholds for these indicators.
    o   Notification Mechanisms: Automated alerts (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) *will* be sent to the operations team when thresholds are breached or critical errors occur.
_   System Administration Functions:
    o   Administrative Interfaces: Secure web-based or command-line tools for system administrators to manage game configurations (e.g., event parameters, store item availability), view system health, manage users (e.g., respond to data requests, handle support issues within the scope of their role and privacy constraints), and inspect logs. Access to these interfaces *must* be role-based, authenticated securely (e.g., MFA), and audited.
    o   Configuration Tools: Mechanisms for updating game configurations without requiring a full client or server redeployment where possible (e.g., remote config for certain game parameters). Changes made via these tools *must* be logged.

**14. Operational Requirements (Consolidated and Expanded)**
_   Backup and Recovery Procedures:
    o   Data Backup Frequency: Automated daily backups of the MongoDB database. Incremental backups *may* be performed more frequently (e.g., every few hours) for critical data.
    o   Retention Policies: Backups *will* be retained for a defined period (e.g., 30 days for daily backups, longer for weekly/monthly snapshots if needed for compliance or business continuity). Retention policies *must* be documented.
    o   Disaster Recovery (DR) Objectives:
        *   Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Target time to restore service after a major incident (e.g., < 4 hours).
        *   Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Maximum acceptable data loss (e.g., < 24 hours, ideally matching backup frequency or less).
    o   DR Plan: A documented DR plan *must* exist, outlining procedures for restoring backend services and databases in a different region or availability zone. This plan *should* be tested periodically (e.g., annually or biannually) to ensure its effectiveness and to train relevant staff.
_   Support and Maintenance Processes:
    o   Incident Handling: A defined process for reporting, triaging, diagnosing, escalating, resolving, and reviewing incidents. This includes communication channels for support staff and escalation procedures to development/operations teams.
    o   Maintenance Windows: Scheduled maintenance windows for backend updates or infrastructure changes *will* be planned to minimize disruption, preferably during off-peak hours, with advance notification to users if significant downtime is expected.
    o   Update Procedures: Documented procedures for deploying client updates (via app stores) and backend updates (via CI/CD pipeline), including pre-deployment testing, rollback plans, and post-deployment verification. A change management policy *will* govern these updates, requiring appropriate approvals.
_   Hours of Operation and Availability:
    o   Uptime Requirements: Backend services *must* target 99.9% availability (SLA).
    o   Scheduled Maintenance: Clearly communicated if it impacts service availability.
    o   The game client *must* function gracefully (e.g., allow offline play of already downloaded levels if designed for it, or show appropriate messaging) if backend services are temporarily unavailable.
