RISK-001,Quality,"The use of `mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed` for the `value` field in the GameConfiguration model allows unstructured data to be saved, bypassing schema validation and potentially leading to data corruption or runtime errors.",4,4,16,High,"WI-2011, WI-3012","The need for a flexible value field sacrifices type safety at the database level, creating a risk of inconsistent data shapes for the same configuration key over time.",Implement strict, schema-based validation within the `ConfigurationService` (WI-3012) using Joi before any data is sent to the repository. The validation schema should be specific to the configuration `key` being updated.,Develop a one-off data cleanup script to find and normalize any malformed `value` objects in the database. Enhance logging to record the full payload of any configuration update that fails application-level validation.,Application logs show validation errors from the ConfigurationService. Client-side reports errors related to unexpected configuration data structure.,Tech Lead,Start of Sprint 3,Open
RISK-002,Security,"Insufficient testing of authentication and authorization middleware on administrative routes could allow unauthorized access to configuration management endpoints.",3,5,15,High,"WI-4023, WI-4022, WI-5013","The complexity of handling multiple user roles (unauthenticated, standard user, admin) and JWT validation can lead to subtle bugs in middleware logic if not tested exhaustively.",In `WI-5013`, create a dedicated integration test suite for security that makes requests to all `/admin/config` endpoints using different roles (e.g., no token, user token, admin token) and asserts the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 401, 403, 200).,If a vulnerability is found in production, immediately block access to the admin routes at the infrastructure level (e.g., API Gateway). Deploy an emergency hotfix. Trigger a full security audit of all authenticated endpoints.,A security scan (static or dynamic) flags an access control vulnerability. A high number of 403 Forbidden errors are logged for admin endpoints, suggesting probing attempts.,Dev Team,Start of Sprint 5,Open
RISK-003,Timeline,"A delay in the Data Access Layer implementation (`EPIC-200`) will have a cascading blocking effect on the Application Services (`EPIC-300`) and Presentation Layer (`EPIC-400`).",3,5,15,High,"WI-3012, WI-4021, WI-4022","Sequential dependencies in the project plan where foundational layers must be completed before higher-level layers can be fully integrated and tested.",The services team (`WS-301`) will start development against the repository interface (`WI-2012`) using a temporary, in-memory mock implementation. This decouples the development of the two layers, allowing for concurrent work.,If the repository implementation (`WI-2013`) is significantly delayed, formalize and extend the use of the mock repository for full integration testing. Re-plan subsequent sprints to account for the new timeline.,The completion date for `WI-2013` slips past its original estimate by more than two days. The services team reports being blocked due to the lack of a real repository for integration.,Project Manager,Start of Sprint 2,Open
RISK-004,Resource,"The high complexity of key tasks, such as the `ConfigurationService` logic (`WI-3012`) and comprehensive testing (`WI-5012`, `WI-5013`), could be underestimated, leading to developer burnout and timeline slips.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-3012, WI-5012, WI-5013","High-complexity tasks are inherently difficult to estimate accurately and often involve unforeseen technical challenges.",Break down all 'High' complexity work items into smaller, estimable sub-tasks (e.g., less than one day of effort). Allocate a spike/investigation task for any sub-task with significant technical uncertainty before providing a final estimate.,If a task is identified as taking significantly longer than estimated, hold a team meeting to re-evaluate the approach. De-scope non-critical features from the current sprint or officially adjust the timeline with stakeholder approval.,A developer reports being stuck on a high-complexity task for more than a day in daily stand-up. Burndown chart shows a flat line for multiple days.,Tech Lead,Start of Sprint 1,Open
RISK-005,Operational,"The multi-stage `Dockerfile` (`WI-6011`) is misconfigured, resulting in an unnecessarily large, insecure, or non-functional container image for production.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-6011, WI-6012","Lack of specific expertise in Docker best practices, such as multi-stage builds, non-root users, and build context optimization.",Incorporate a Docker linter (e.g., `hadolint`) into the CI pipeline to automatically check the `Dockerfile` for common errors and bad practices. Mandate a peer review for any changes to the `Dockerfile` or `.dockerignore` files.,If the production build is failing, temporarily revert to a simpler, working single-stage Dockerfile to unblock deployments. Allocate developer time for targeted training or pair programming on Docker best practices.,CI build for `WI-6011` fails. The final Docker image size exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 250MB). A security scanner flags vulnerabilities in the built container image (e.g., running as root).,Dev Team,Start of Sprint 6,Open
RISK-006,External,"The external `IAuditLoggingService` dependency is unavailable or its API contract changes, blocking the completion of the `updateConfiguration` feature.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-3011, WI-3012","Reliance on an external microservice that is outside the direct control of the development team.",Implement the `ConfigurationService` (`WI-3012`) to be resilient to audit service failures. The core logic (updating the config in the DB) should succeed even if the audit log call fails. The failure to log should be caught, logged internally, and trigger a monitoring alert.,If the external service is down for an extended period, create a temporary in-memory queue within the `REPO-GLYPH-SYSTEM` service to hold pending audit logs and retry sending them periodically.,Monitoring dashboards show a spike in error rates for calls to the `IAuditLoggingService`. The `updateConfiguration` method logs errors related to the audit call.,Dev Team,Start of Sprint 3,Open
RISK-007,Technical,"The health check endpoint (`WI-4021`) is too basic and only checks the Mongoose connection state, potentially reporting 'ok' even when the service is in a degraded state (e.g., database query latency is high).",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-4021, WI-1014","An overly simplistic definition of ""health"" that doesn't account for performance or downstream dependency health.",Enhance the `getSystemHealth` method (`WI-3012`) to perform a lightweight, read-only database query (e.g., `db.command({ ping: 1 })`) and measure the response time. The health check should fail if the ping takes longer than a set threshold (e.g., 500ms).,If the service is experiencing performance issues not caught by the health check, manually add more detailed checks. Implement a dedicated metrics endpoint (e.g., Prometheus format) for more granular performance monitoring.,Users report API slowness, but the `/health` endpoint consistently returns 200 OK. Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools show high database latency.,Dev Team,Start of Sprint 4,Open
RISK-008,Quality,"The use of `mongodb-memory-server` for integration tests (`WI-5013`) may mask production-specific issues that would only appear with a real MongoDB instance (e.g., related to replica sets, network latency, or specific query engine behavior).",2,3,6,Low,"WI-5013, WI-2013","Discrepancies between the in-memory test database and the production database environment.",Accept this risk for fast CI feedback. Supplement integration tests with a suite of end-to-end (E2E) tests that run against a staging environment using a real, production-like MongoDB cluster. Run these E2E tests nightly or before a production release.,If a bug is found in production that was not caught by integration tests, write a new regression test for it. If the bug is due to environmental differences, create a new E2E test case that specifically targets the issue in the staging environment.,An issue is detected in the staging or production environment that cannot be reproduced in the local integration test suite.,QA/Test Engineer,Start of Sprint 5,Open
RISK-009,Configuration,"Sensitive information like `JWT_SECRET` or `MONGO_URI` is accidentally committed to the git repository or mismanaged in the deployment environment.",2,5,10,Medium,"WI-1013, WI-6011","Improper handling of application secrets, often due to developer oversight or lack of a centralized secret management system.",Implement a pre-commit hook (e.g., using `husky` and `git-secrets`) to scan for secret patterns before allowing a commit. Use a `.env.example` file (`WI-1013`) to document required variables, and ensure the real `.env` file is in `.gitignore`.,If a secret is leaked, immediately revoke the compromised credential (e.g., rotate the JWT secret, change the database password). Scan the entire git history to purge the secret. Re-issue all active JWTs.,A security audit finds secrets in the git history. A developer accidentally commits a `.env` file. The application fails to start in production due to missing secrets provided by the orchestrator.,Tech Lead,Start of Sprint 1,Open
RISK-010,Technical,"The `getLiveConfiguration` method in the service (`WI-3012`) fetches all configurations from the database on every call, which could cause performance issues if the number of configurations grows.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-3012, WI-4021","A naive implementation that does not consider the scalability or performance impact of a frequently called endpoint.",Implement a caching layer (e.g., in-memory cache with a short Time-To-Live like NodeCache, or an external Redis cache) in the `ConfigurationService`. The cache would be populated on the first call and invalidated whenever a configuration is updated via the admin endpoint.,If performance degrades in production, implement the caching strategy as an urgent hotfix. Add metrics to monitor the cache hit/miss ratio and the execution time of the `findAll()` repository method.,APM tools show that the `/api/v1/system/config` endpoint has a high average response time. Database monitoring shows high CPU usage from frequent `find` queries on the `gameconfigurations` collection.,Dev Team,Start of Sprint 4,Open
