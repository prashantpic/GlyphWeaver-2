RISK-MIG-001,Technical,"The initial migration script (`WI-MIG-202`) contains errors, such as incorrect collection names or improperly configured indexes (e.g., missing unique constraint), leading to silent data corruption or severe application performance issues.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-MIG-202, WI-MIG-203, WI-MIG-204",Human error in translating a complex database design document into a large, monolithic migration script.,Mandate a rigorous peer review of the initial schema script against the DB design document. Implement an automated test that introspects the schema after migration to verify collection names and index properties programmatically.,Create a new, corrective migration script to fix the schema discrepancy. For critical errors found post-launch, a DBA may need to apply a hotfix directly to the database, followed by a corrective migration commit.,Automated schema verification test fails in CI. Post-deployment performance monitoring shows unexpectedly slow queries on a new collection.,Tech Lead,,Open
RISK-MIG-002,Quality,"A migration's `down` function is faulty or incomplete, failing to correctly revert the changes made by the `up` function. This makes automated rollbacks impossible and severely complicates disaster recovery.",3,5,15,High,"WI-MIG-202, WI-MIG-203, WI-MIG-204","Lack of rigorous testing for `down` scripts, as they are used less frequently than `up` scripts. Developers may focus only on the forward path.",Implement a mandatory CI check for every PR that adds a migration. The check must run the full migration suite `up`, then run the new migration's `down` script, and verify the database schema has returned to its previous state via a snapshot comparison.,If a rollback is required and the script fails, a DBA must perform a manual schema change based on the faulty `down` script's intent. The deployment is halted, and a hotfix for the `down` script is required before proceeding.,The automated 'up/down' cycle test fails in the CI pipeline.,DevOps Lead,,Open
RISK-MIG-003,Operational,"A data migration script (e.g., `WI-MIG-204` adding `lastLogin`) performs an `updateMany` operation on a large production collection, causing extended table locks, application timeouts, and effective downtime during the deployment window.",3,5,15,High,WI-MIG-204,Failure to test migration performance against production-scale data volumes.,Mandate that all data-altering migrations are tested against a staging environment with a recent, anonymized snapshot of production data. For collections over a certain size, migrations must be designed to run in smaller, non-locking batches.,Establish a maximum acceptable execution time for migrations in the CI/CD pipeline. Have a DBA on-call during deployments to monitor and kill long-running migration queries. Immediately trigger the rollback plan.,Migration execution time in staging or production pipeline exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 3 minutes).,DevOps Lead,,Open
RISK-MIG-004,Operational,"Incorrect or missing environment variables (`MIGRATE_MONGO_URI`) in a deployment environment cause the migration tool to fail or, worse, connect to the wrong database instance, corrupting another environment's data.",2,5,10,Medium,"WI-MIG-103, Entire CI/CD process",Manual configuration of environment variables and lack of automated checks at runtime.,Use a centralized secret management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) to inject DB credentials. The `migrate-mongo-config.ts` script must include startup logic that fails fast if required environment variables are not set.,If migrations run against the wrong environment, immediately revoke the DB credentials, restore the affected database from the most recent backup, and conduct a post-mortem to fix the pipeline configuration gap.,Migration script fails on startup due to missing environment variables. A `migrate:status` check in a lower environment shows unexpected migrations have been applied.,DevOps Lead,,Open
RISK-MIG-005,Quality,"A data migration script (like `WI-MIG-204`) fails mid-execution due to unexpected data patterns (e.g., a document missing the `createdAt` field), leaving the collection in a partially migrated, inconsistent state.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-MIG-204,Script logic does not account for all possible edge cases or historical data states. Insufficient data analysis before writing the migration script.,Write defensive migration scripts. Before a mass update, query for documents that might violate assumptions. Wrap migration logic in transactions where appropriate. Log any documents that are skipped or fail to update.,The `down` script must be able to handle a partially migrated state. A separate cleanup script may need to be written and run to either complete the migration or revert the partially applied changes.,Migration script logs errors or fails during execution in the pipeline. Post-deployment data validation checks fail.,Tech Lead,,Open
RISK-MIG-006,External,"The `migrate-mongo` library is abandoned, becomes incompatible with future Node.js or MongoDB versions, or has a critical, unfixed bug that blocks development or deployment.",2,4,8,Medium,All WIs,Dependency on a single third-party open-source tool for a critical operational process.,Choose well-maintained libraries with active communities. Pin dependency versions using `package-lock.json` to prevent unexpected updates. Periodically evaluate the health of key dependencies.,If the library becomes unusable, plan an engineering project to either fork and patch the library internally or migrate to a different, more actively maintained migration framework.,A critical bug is discovered and remains unfixed for an extended period. The library is marked as deprecated or shows no repository activity for over a year.,Architect,,Open
RISK-MIG-007,Technical,"The TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/collections.ts` are not created or used, leading to a higher likelihood of typos and logical errors in migration scripts (e.g., using `$set` on a misspelled field name).",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-MIG-201, WI-MIG-202, WI-MIG-203, WI-MIG-204",Developer oversight or skipping the type definition task (`WI-MIG-201`) to save time.,Enforce strict TypeScript compiler options. Make `WI-MIG-201` a blocking dependency for all migration implementation tasks. Use code reviews to ensure types are imported and used correctly, e.g. `db.collection<IPlayerProfile>('PlayerProfile')`.,If an error is caused by a lack of typing, a corrective migration script must be written to fix the bad data. A technical debt ticket should be created to go back and apply the correct types.,A migration script fails due to a typo that would have been caught by the type-checker. A code review finds migration scripts are not using the defined interfaces.,Tech Lead,,Open
RISK-MIG-008,Timeline,"The complexity of the initial schema creation (`WI-MIG-202`) is underestimated, causing delays that block subsequent development of dependent features and other migration scripts.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-MIG-202, WI-MIG-203, WI-MIG-204","The task is large, tedious, and highly detailed, making it prone to estimation error and rework.",Break down the initial schema creation into smaller, per-collection PRs if possible. Assign the task to a senior developer with strong MongoDB experience. Allocate buffer time in the project plan for this specific task.,If a delay occurs, de-scope non-essential indexes from the initial migration and add them in a subsequent migration to unblock core development. Re-prioritize project timelines based on the delay.,The task remains incomplete after the allocated time in the sprint has passed.,Project Manager,,Open
