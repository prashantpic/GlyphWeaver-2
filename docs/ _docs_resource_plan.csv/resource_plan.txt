TASK-MIG-001,"Configure package.json with dependencies and scripts",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,2.0,Junior,1,"",Yes,"A developer familiar with Node.js and npm can complete this quickly.","Use a project generator like 'npm init -y' and then manually add the specific dependencies and scripts."
TASK-MIG-002,"Configure tsconfig.json for the project",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,1.8,Junior,1,TASK-MIG-001,Yes,Requires basic knowledge of TypeScript configuration.,"Start with a standard TypeScript template (e.g., from 'ts-node-dev') and modify it for the project's needs."
TASK-MIG-003,"Implement migrate-mongo-config.ts to load DB config from environment variables",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,3.2,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-001,Yes,"Developer needs to understand environment variables, the 'dotenv' package, and basic TypeScript.","Use a configuration library like 'convict' or 'config' for more robust configuration management, especially if more variables are expected."
TASK-MIG-004,"Integration test for migrate-mongo-config.ts",Quality Assurance,DevOps,Low,1.8,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-003,Yes,"Can be done by the same developer as TASK-MIG-003 or a QA engineer. Requires a local MongoDB instance.","A simple manual test by running 'npm run migrate:status' and checking the output could suffice initially, but an automated test is better for CI/CD."
TASK-MIG-005,"Define TypeScript interfaces for Player & Progression collections",Backend Development,Data Engineering,Medium,6.0,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-002,Yes,"Requires careful translation of the database design document into TypeScript interfaces. Attention to detail is key.","Use a schema-first approach with a tool like Zod or TypeBox to generate both validation schemas and TypeScript types from a single source of truth."
TASK-MIG-006,"Define TypeScript interfaces for Game Content & System collections",Backend Development,Data Engineering,Medium,6.0,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-002,Yes,"Similar to the previous task, requires high attention to detail. Could be done in parallel with TASK-MIG-005 by a different developer.","Use a schema-first approach with a tool like Zod or TypeBox to generate both validation schemas and TypeScript types from a single source of truth."
TASK-MIG-007,"Write README.md for repository usage and CI/CD integration",Product Management,DevOps,Medium,4.2,Mid,1,"TASK-MIG-001,TASK-MIG-003",No,"Requires good technical writing skills. Best done by someone who has completed the initial setup tasks.","Generate documentation from source code comments using a tool like TypeDoc, then add a manual wrapper with usage instructions."
TASK-MIG-008,"Implement initial schema up logic for collection creation",Backend Development,Database,Medium,6.3,Mid,1,"TASK-MIG-005,TASK-MIG-006",Yes,"Tedious but straightforward task. Using the TypeScript interfaces from previous tasks is crucial to avoid typos in collection names.","Break this into multiple smaller migration scripts, one for each logical group of collections (e.g., player, content, system), to reduce the size of a single change."
TASK-MIG-009,"Implement initial schema up logic for index creation",Backend Development,Database,High,9.0,Senior,1,TASK-MIG-008,Yes,"This is a critical performance task. Requires a developer with strong MongoDB indexing knowledge to correctly implement unique, compound, and sparse indexes.","Create collections and indexes in the same step using the 'create' command with an 'index' option, though this can make the code less readable and harder to review."
TASK-MIG-010,"Implement initial schema down function to drop all collections",Backend Development,Database,Low,3.2,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-008,Yes,"Simple task, but crucial for testability and rollbacks. Must ensure all collections created in 'up' are dropped.","Have a separate cleanup script that reads collection names from a config file to drop them, making it less prone to mismatches with the 'up' function."
TASK-MIG-011,"Integration test and verification for initial schema migration",Quality Assurance,DevOps,Medium,6.7,Senior,1,"TASK-MIG-009,TASK-MIG-010",Yes,"Requires a QA engineer or DevOps specialist with strong scripting skills (Jest/Mocha) and knowledge of MongoDB schema introspection.","A manual verification checklist for a QA engineer to run, though this is not repeatable, is error-prone, and unsuitable for CI."
TASK-MIG-012,"Implement up/down functions for add-player-inventory migration",Backend Development,Database,Low,3.1,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-011,Yes,"Standard migration implementation. A good task for a mid-level developer.","Combine this migration with other small schema changes into a single feature-based migration to reduce the number of files."
TASK-MIG-013,"Integration test for add-player-inventory migration",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Low,3.2,Mid,1,TASK-MIG-012,Yes,"Builds on the testing framework from TASK-MIG-011. Should be a straightforward extension.","Extend the existing initial schema test suite to include this migration, rather than creating a new, separate test file."
TASK-MIG-014,"Implement up/down functions for add-last-login-to-player-profile migration",Backend Development,Database,Medium,4.8,Senior,1,TASK-MIG-011,Yes,"Data migration is more complex than schema migration. Requires knowledge of MongoDB aggregation pipelines and potential performance implications.","Perform the data backfill as a separate, offline script rather than part of the deployment migration to reduce deployment time risk."
TASK-MIG-015,"Integration test for add-last-login data migration",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,6.3,Senior,1,TASK-MIG-014,Yes,"Testing data transformations requires careful setup of pre-conditions and assertions for various edge cases. QA must work closely with the developer.","Manual verification on a staging database with a small set of hand-crafted test documents. Not recommended for regression."
TASK-MIG-016,"[Risk Mitigation] Performance test add-last-login migration",DevOps,Database,High,12.2,Senior,1,TASK-MIG-015,Yes,"This is a critical risk mitigation task. Requires a DevOps or DB performance specialist. Involves setting up a production-like environment and data generation scripts.","Instead of a full performance test, run a database 'explain()' on the update query to analyze its execution plan and estimate its performance impact. Less accurate but faster."
