RISK-001,External,"Apple/Google IAP validation APIs change or have undocumented behavior, causing validation logic to fail.",4,5,20,High,"WI-IAP-3012, WI-IAP-3013, WI-IAP-4011","Dependency on volatile third-party APIs not under project control. Apple's API in particular has many nuanced status codes.",- Create an adapter for each gateway to isolate platform-specific logic. - During implementation, thoroughly research and document all known status codes and response formats for both platforms. - Implement flexible parsing of responses. - Add extensive unit tests covering all known success, failure, and edge-case responses (e.g., Apple's sandbox code 21007).,"If a new/unknown error code appears, the system should mark the transaction status as 'validation_error', preserve the raw platform response, and trigger a high-priority alert for manual investigation. A hotfix to the gateway adapter would then be required.",Monitoring alert for a spike in 'validation_error' statuses or logs indicating unknown platform response codes.,Tech Lead,,Open
RISK-002,Technical,"The orchestration logic in IAPValidationService fails to handle partial success, such as when validation succeeds but fulfillment with the Player Service fails, leading to lost or unfulfilled purchases.",3,5,15,High,WI-IAP-4011,"This is a distributed transaction problem. A failure between two separate service calls can leave the system in an inconsistent state without proper state management and recovery logic.",- Implement a robust state machine in the IAPTransaction aggregate. - The service must persist the transaction state to the DB after each critical step (e.g., 'pending' -> 'validated' -> 'fulfilled'). - Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the call to the Player Service Gateway. - If fulfillment ultimately fails, the transaction status must be set to 'error' or 'fulfillment_pending' to signify it needs attention.,"Create a background job or an admin tool that periodically queries for transactions in 'error' or 'fulfillment_pending' state and attempts to re-process the fulfillment. Trigger a critical alert if a transaction remains in this state for more than a specified period (e.g., 1 hour).","Dashboard widget showing count of transactions in 'error' or 'fulfillment_pending' state. Alerts if this count is > 0 for a sustained period.",Backend Lead,,Open

They can be accidentally committed to git, exposed in logs, or improperly managed in CI/CD/deployment environments.",- Use a secure secret management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Encrypted Secrets) to store all secrets. - Inject secrets into the application environment at runtime; do not hardcode or commit them. - Ensure the configuration module (WI-IAP-1013) never logs the loaded secret values. - Implement strict access controls on the secret store and CI/CD environment variables.,"Immediately revoke the compromised secret and issue a new one. Audit logs to determine the extent of the breach. Scan git history to ensure the secret is fully purged.",Code scanning tools (e.g., GitGuardian) flagging committed secrets. Regular audits of access to secret stores.,DevOps Lead,,Open
RISK-004,Technical,"Duplicate transaction processing (replay attacks) is not prevented, allowing a single valid receipt to be used multiple times to grant items.",3,5,15,High,"WI-IAP-2021, WI-IAP-2022, WI-IAP-4011","Failure to enforce uniqueness at the database level or check for existing transactions before processing in the application layer.",- Define a unique compound index on `{ platform: 1, platformTransactionId: 1 }` in the Mongoose schema (WI-IAP-2021). This is the most critical prevention. - The IAPValidationService must *always* query the repository for an existing transaction using the platform's transaction ID before initiating new validation logic. If found, it should return a 409 Conflict immediately.,"If a duplicate is somehow processed (e.g., due to a race condition before the index was added), a manual process must be run to identify and reconcile the duplicate grants. The root cause (e.g., missing DB index) must be fixed immediately.",Alerts on database errors related to unique index violations, which could indicate a bug in the application-level check. Regular audit queries to find records with duplicate `platformTransactionId`s.,Backend Lead,,Open
RISK-005,External,"The internal Player Service is unavailable or returns an error, preventing item fulfillment.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-IAP-3014, WI-IAP-4011","The service has a hard dependency on another microservice, which introduces a point of failure outside its direct control.",- The HttpPlayerServiceGateway must implement a resilient HTTP client with appropriate timeouts and retry logic (with exponential backoff). - The application service must correctly handle the failure response from the gateway, as described in RISK-002 mitigation. - Establish a clear Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the team owning the Player Service.","Follow the contingency plan for RISK-002: mark the transaction for later processing and alert the operations team. The alert should specify that the Player Service is the point of failure.",Spike in 5xx error responses from the Player Service endpoint. A high number of logs with messages like ""Player Service credit failed"". An increase in transactions being moved to the 'fulfillment_pending' state.,Backend Lead,,Open
RISK-006,Quality,"Unit and integration tests have insufficient coverage of failure paths and edge cases, particularly for gateway responses.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-IAP-5013, WI-IAP-5014","High-complexity tasks are prone to subtle bugs. Without testing all logical branches (especially error handling), bugs may only appear in production.",- Enforce a strict code coverage threshold in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., >85%). - Conduct peer reviews specifically focused on test coverage. Ensure every `if` and `catch` block in the orchestration service is tested. - For gateways, create mock responses for every known status code and error condition from the external platforms.","If a production bug is found that was not covered by tests, a new test case replicating the bug must be written and committed along with the fix. This prevents regressions.",Code coverage reports from the CI/CD pipeline falling below the target threshold. Production bugs occurring in logic that was not unit tested.,QA Lead,,Open
RISK-007,Timeline,"The complexity of implementing the Apple and Google validation gateways is underestimated, causing delays.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-IAP-3012, WI-IAP-3013","Each platform has its own complex authentication, request/response format, and error handling nuances that are not immediately obvious from documentation.",- Assign the gateway tasks to senior developers, preferably with prior experience with these specific APIs. - Timebox an initial 'Spike' or proof-of-concept task to de-risk the implementation before committing to a full estimate. - Implement one gateway completely before starting the other to apply learnings.","If a task is falling behind, re-evaluate the remaining work and potentially assign another developer to pair-program and accelerate completion. Descope non-critical features if necessary to maintain the overall project timeline.",The time spent on the gateway implementation work items significantly exceeds the initial estimate during sprint tracking.,Project Manager,,Open
RISK-008,Technical,"The mapping logic between the Domain Aggregate and the Mongoose persistence model in the repository is incorrect, leading to data loss or corruption during save/load operations.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-IAP-2022,"The separation between the domain model and the data model requires explicit mapping, which is a potential source of bugs if properties are missed or mapped incorrectly.",- Write dedicated unit tests for the mapper functions that convert domain objects to persistence models and back. - Use a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach for the repository implementation, writing tests before the implementation to ensure it meets the contract. - Peer review of the repository implementation should focus heavily on the mapping logic.","If data corruption is detected, a data migration script will be needed to correct the affected records. The bug in the mapper must be fixed, and a new, more comprehensive test must be added.",Discrepancies found during integration testing or manual QA between the data sent to the API and the data stored in the database.,Backend Lead,,Open
RISK-009,Operational,"Insufficient or unstructured logging makes debugging failed transactions in production nearly impossible.",3,4,12,Medium,WI-IAP-6012,"Without proper context (like transaction IDs, user IDs) and structured formats (JSON), sifting through logs to trace a single transaction's lifecycle is extremely difficult.",- Enforce a logging standard where every log entry related to a specific request includes a unique trace/transaction ID. - Log at the entry and exit of every major function/method in the orchestration flow, including key data points (but not secrets). - Use structured JSON logging in production (WI-IAP-6012).","If a production issue arises that cannot be diagnosed due to poor logging, the immediate next step after fixing the issue is to add the necessary log statements to prevent a recurrence. A 'logging debt' backlog item should be created.",During a test or production incident, a developer reports that they cannot trace the flow of a request due to missing or unhelpful log messages.,DevOps Lead,,Open

The project manager must immediately re-plan the timeline based on the bottleneck, potentially pulling in another senior developer from a different team temporarily to get up to speed.",A key developer is assigned to another higher-priority project or gives notice.,Project Manager,,Open
RISK-011,Technical,"The CI/CD pipeline is flaky or slow, hindering development velocity and frustrating developers.",3,2,6,Low,WI-IAP-6013,"Poorly configured caching, inefficient test execution, or complex build steps can lead to a CI pipeline that is not trusted or effective.",- Implement caching for dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`) in the CI pipeline. - Run pipeline steps in parallel where possible (e.g., linting and unit testing). - Optimize the Docker build using multi-stage builds and an efficient `.dockerignore` file.","Dedicate developer time to 'hardening' the pipeline. Treat CI/CD as production code and assign story points to fixing its issues.
