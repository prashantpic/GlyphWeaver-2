RISK-001,Technical,"The compound index for ranking queries in `playerScore.model.ts` is defined incorrectly (e.g., wrong field order), leading to slow database queries and API timeouts under load.",3,5,15,High,"WI-201, WI-203, WI-305","Complexity of creating a multi-field index that must match the exact query sort order. A simple mistake in field order or direction renders the index ineffective for sorting.",Implement a mandatory peer review for all Mongoose schema changes. During integration testing, use MongoDB's `.explain('executionStats')` on the ranking query to programmatically verify that the correct index is being used and that the number of scanned documents is low.,"Have a runbook prepared for dropping the incorrect index and rebuilding the correct one in the production database with zero downtime. This can be done by creating the new index first, then dropping the old one once the application is deployed to use it.",API latency for GET /leaderboard/:leaderboardKey exceeds 500ms P95. MongoDB query execution time for `findByLeaderboard` exceeds 200ms.,Lead Developer,2024-08-15,Open
RISK-002,Quality,"The `getPlayerRank` logic in `ScoreRepository` is buggy, especially concerning tie-breaking, resulting in incorrect ranks being calculated and displayed to users.",4,4,16,High,"WI-203, WI-305, WI-403","The logic for calculating rank with multiple tie-breaking fields (`scoreValue`, `completionTime`, `timestamp`) is inherently complex and prone to off-by-one or sorting errors.",Write extensive unit tests for the `ScoreRepository.getPlayerRank` method with specific edge cases: ties in score, ties in score and first tie-breaker, no ties, first rank, last rank. Use a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for this specific method.,"If a bug is found in production, have a hotfix deployment pipeline ready. A temporary solution could be to disable the rank display and show ""Processing..."" while a fix is deployed.",User reports of incorrect ranking. Automated checks comparing rank calculation from a sample dataset against expected results fail.,Lead Developer,2024-08-20,Open
RISK-003,Security,"The cheat detection hash validation in `CheatDetectionService` is flawed, either allowing manipulated scores (false negative) or rejecting legitimate scores (false positive), compromising leaderboard integrity or user experience.",3,5,15,High,"WI-303, WI-305, WI-403","Discrepancy in the hash generation logic between the client and server (e.g., data type differences, field order, secret key mismatch).",Define a strict, versioned contract for the data string to be hashed. Log all hash validation failures with the received hash and the server-calculated hash for debugging. During development, create a shared utility or test case that both client and server can use to verify their hashing implementations match.,"Implement a feature flag to bypass the hash check for all submissions in an emergency. This would be a ""fail-open"" strategy to prevent blocking legitimate players, while still logging submissions for later review. A second flag could enable it only for a subset of test users.",A high rate of `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY` logs for `validationHash` mismatch. A spike in player complaints about score submission failures.,Lead Developer,2024-08-22,Open
RISK-004,Technical,"The cache invalidation logic in `LeaderboardService` is incomplete or incorrect, leading to users seeing stale leaderboard data after new scores are submitted.",4,4,16,High,"WI-305, WI-501","Complexity of identifying all relevant cache keys to invalidate. For paginated results, multiple keys (`leaderboard:X:limit:50:offset:0`, `leaderboard:X:limit:50:offset:50`, etc.) exist for one leaderboard.",Instead of pattern-based invalidation, use Redis Sets. For each leaderboard (e.g., `global_scores`), maintain a set (`keys:global_scores`) that stores the cache keys of all its paginated views. When a score is submitted, retrieve all members of the set and delete them with a single `DEL` command.,Have a manual/emergency API endpoint or script to flush the entire Redis cache. This is a blunt instrument but effective for immediate recovery from a widespread stale data issue.,After a user submits a high score, a subsequent GET request for the first page of the same leaderboard does not show the new score within the cache TTL period.,Lead Developer,2024-08-25,Open
RISK-005,Operational,"The pattern-based cache invalidation in `CacheProvider` uses the `KEYS` command in Redis, which is a blocking operation and can cause performance degradation or an outage of the entire Redis instance under load.",4,5,20,High,"WI-501, WI-305","The SDS and task description suggest using a pattern, and a naive implementation using `KEYS` is common but dangerous in production as it scans the entire keyspace.",Strictly prohibit the use of `KEYS` in production code. The mitigation strategy for RISK-004 (using Redis Sets to track keys) must be implemented. The `invalidateByPattern` method should be implemented to use this Set-based approach.,"If `KEYS` is accidentally deployed, immediately trigger a rollback. If that's not possible, have the Redis instance plan scaled up vertically to better handle the load temporarily while a hotfix is prepared. Monitor the Redis `slowlog` for `KEYS` commands.",Redis CPU utilization spikes to >90%. Monitoring alerts for high latency on Redis commands. Presence of `KEYS` command in the Redis `slowlog`.,DevOps Engineer,2024-08-18,Open
RISK-006,Timeline,"The complexity and effort for setting up a robust integration testing environment (`WI-603`) is significantly underestimated, delaying the entire testing phase and project delivery.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-603, EPIC-600","Integration tests require orchestration of multiple services (Node app, MongoDB, Redis), data seeding, and state cleanup between tests, which is complex and time-consuming to configure correctly.",Begin setting up the integration test framework (e.g., using Docker Compose) early in the project lifecycle, in parallel with initial development, rather than leaving it until the end. Create a template for new integration tests to standardize the setup/teardown process.,"If the setup proves too complex, scale back the scope of integration tests to cover only the most critical end-to-end flows. Rely more heavily on unit tests and conduct more thorough manual QA as a fallback.",The task `WI-603` exceeds its estimated effort by more than 50%. The CI pipeline is still not reliably running integration tests by the planned feature-complete date.,QA Lead,2024-09-01,Open
RISK-007,Security,"The `SCORE_SECRET` or `JWT_SECRET` keys are accidentally hardcoded or committed to version control, leading to a severe security vulnerability.",2,5,10,Medium,"WI-303, WI-502","Developer oversight or lack of familiarity with secure secret management practices.",Implement a pre-commit hook (e.g., using `husky` and `git-secrets`) that scans for patterns resembling secret keys and prevents the commit if any are found. Use a `.env` file for local development (and add `.env` to `.gitignore`) and use a managed secret store (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for production environments.,"If a secret is committed, immediately rotate the secret. This involves generating a new secret, deploying it to all environments, and then revoking the old one. All existing sessions/tokens must be invalidated. The git history should be purged of the secret.",A security scanner (e.g., GitGuardian) detects a secret in the repository history. A manual code review finds a hardcoded secret.,Security Lead,2024-08-10,Open
RISK-008,Quality,"The integration tests (`WI-603`) are flaky (pass and fail intermittently without code changes), eroding trust in the test suite and CI/CD pipeline.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-603","Race conditions in asynchronous tests, or failure to properly isolate and clean up state (database records, cache entries) between test runs.",Ensure every integration test is fully self-contained. Implement a robust `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hook in the test suite to programmatically clean the database (e.g., delete all documents from relevant collections) and flush the Redis cache (`FLUSHDB`) before each test runs.,"Temporarily disable the flaky test from the CI pipeline to prevent blocking other developers. Create a high-priority technical debt ticket to fix the test. Implement automated retries for tests in the CI pipeline as a short-term workaround.",A specific test fails in the CI pipeline but passes when run locally. The same pull request shows different test results on subsequent runs.,QA Lead,2024-09-05,Open
RISK-009,Resource,"The high-complexity tasks (`WI-203`, `WI-305`, `WI-601`, `WI-603`) are dependent on a single developer, creating a bottleneck and a key-person dependency.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-203, WI-305, WI-601, WI-603","Project staffing does not account for the specialized skills required for complex components like database optimization and advanced testing.",Enforce pair programming for all high-complexity tasks. Mandate that all code must have comprehensive JSDoc comments and be accompanied by unit tests. Conduct internal knowledge-sharing sessions where the lead developer explains the architecture of the complex components to the rest of the team.,"If the key person becomes unavailable, re-prioritize the backlog to allow other team members to work on simpler tasks. Allocate an emergency budget for an external consultant with expertise in the required area (e.g., MongoDB performance tuning).",A high-complexity task is blocked for more than 48 hours due to the unavailability of the assigned developer.,Project Manager,2024-08-01,Open

Enforce a policy to fail the build if high-severity vulnerabilities are found. Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to create a minimal final image.,"If a critical vulnerability is discovered in production, immediately patch and redeploy the service. If a patch is not available, apply virtual patching at the WAF/API gateway level if possible, and prioritize finding an alternative base image or dependency.",The CI pipeline's image scan reports a new high or critical severity vulnerability.
