TSK-009,"Implement `leaderboard.model.ts` schema and index",Backend Development,Database,Medium,3.0,Mid,1,TASK-103-1,Yes,"Core data model for leaderboard configuration. The unique index on `keyName` is critical for data integrity.","Store leaderboard configuration in a JSON file if it's static, but this prevents dynamic creation via an admin panel."
TSK-010,"Define TypeScript interface for `ILeaderboard`",Backend Development,,Low,1.2,Mid,1,"TASK-202-1,TASK-301-1",Yes,"Ensures type safety for leaderboard configuration objects throughout the application.","Don't create a separate interface and use the Mongoose-inferred type directly, reducing code but increasing coupling."
TSK-011,"Scaffold `ScoreRepository` class",Backend Development,Database,Low,2.0,Mid,1,"TASK-201-3,TASK-301-1",Yes,"Sets up the data access pattern for the `PlayerScore` model.
