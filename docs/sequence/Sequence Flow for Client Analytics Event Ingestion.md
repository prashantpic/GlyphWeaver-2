# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Client Analytics Event Ingestion
  Details how the client collects, batches, and sends user behavior and game events to the backend analytics service for processing and analysis.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To provide the data necessary for game balancing, feature evaluation, and understanding player behavior.

  #### .5. Type
  DataFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-GLYPH-CLIENT-UNITY
  - REPO-GLYPH-ANALYTICS
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Client tracks a series of events (e.g., levelstart, hintused, store_opened) based on user actions.
  - These events are stored in a local batch queue on the client.
  - On a timer or when the batch size is reached, the Client sends the batch of events to REPO-GLYPH-ANALYTICS.
  - REPO-GLYPH-ANALYTICS receives the batch, validates the event schema, and ingests the data into a data store for analysis.
  - Client clears its local queue upon successful transmission.
  
  #### .8. Related Feature Ids
  
  - REQ-13
  
  #### .9. Domain
  Analytics

  #### .10. Metadata
  
  - **Complexity:** Low
  - **Priority:** Medium
