# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Procedural Level Generation and Gameplay
  Shows the process of generating a new, unique level for the player after the hand-crafted levels are complete. This includes client-side generation and logging the seed to the backend for reproducibility.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To illustrate the mechanism for providing infinite replayability.

  #### .5. Type
  FeatureFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-GLYPH-CLIENT-UNITY
  - REPO-GLYPH-GAMECONTENT
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Client determines the player needs a new procedural level.
  - Client's procedural generation algorithm uses zone parameters to generate a level layout, solution, and unique seed.
  - The generator verifies the level is solvable and meets difficulty criteria.
  - Client logs the generated level's seed and parameters to REPO-GLYPH-GAMECONTENT for support and verification purposes.
  - Client presents the generated level to the player.
  - Gameplay proceeds as with a hand-crafted level.
