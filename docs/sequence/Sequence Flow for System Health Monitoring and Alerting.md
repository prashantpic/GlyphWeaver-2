# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . System Health Monitoring and Alerting
  Shows how an external monitoring system actively checks the health of the backend services and triggers alerts to the operations team when performance thresholds are breached.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To ensure high availability and proactive issue resolution as per operational requirements.

  #### .5. Type
  ServiceInteraction

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-GLYPH-MONITORING
  - REPO-GLYPH-SYSTEM
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - A monitoring tool (configured by REPO-GLYPH-MONITORING) scrapes metrics from backend services (REPO-GLYPH-SYSTEM).
  - The tool evaluates a rule (e.g., 'API P95 latency  500ms for 5 minutes').
  - When the rule condition becomes true, an alert is fired.
  - The alert manager routes the notification to the configured channel (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack).
  - The operations team receives the alert and begins incident response procedures.
