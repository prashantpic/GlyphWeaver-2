    note over REPO-GLYPH-LEADERBOARD: A cache-aside pattern is used. The service checks the cache first. If data is missing (a miss), it queries the database, then populates the cache before returning the response.

        activate Cache-Redis
        note right of Cache-Redis: Data is stored in the cache with a Time-To-Live (TTL) (e.g., 60 seconds) to ensure the leaderboard remains reasonably fresh without constant database queries.
