  ### . Client-Side Save Data Migration on App Update
  Models the robust process required on the client to handle changes in the local save data format between app versions, ensuring no data loss for the player.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To maintain backward compatibility and prevent player data loss during app updates.

  #### .5. Type
  DataFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-GLYPH-CLIENT-UNITY
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Player launches the newly updated game client for the first time.
  - Client attempts to load the local save file and detects a version mismatch in the data schema.
  - Client executes a pre-defined migration function to transform the old data structure into the new one.
  - The migration is performed in-memory or to a temporary file.
  - After successful transformation, the client overwrites the old save file with the new, migrated data.
  - The game then proceeds to load the state from the newly formatted data.
  - The new data is then synced to cloud save services.
