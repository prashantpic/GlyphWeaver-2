# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Cloud Save Synchronization on Login
  Models how player data is synchronized when a player logs in. It includes checking for a newer save in the cloud, handling potential conflicts, and updating the local client state.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To provide a seamless cross-device experience and prevent data loss for players.

  #### .5. Type
  DataFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-GLYPH-CLIENT-UNITY
  - REPO-GLYPH-PLAYER
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Client authenticates with the platform service (Game Center/Google Play).
  - Client requests the latest cloud save data from the platform service.
  - Client compares the timestamp of the cloud save with the local save.
  - If a conflict exists, the Client prompts the user to choose which save to keep.
  - Client loads the selected save data (player progress, settings, inventory) into the game state.
  - Any server-authoritative data (e.g., virtual currency) is synced separately with REPO-GLYPH-PLAYER.
