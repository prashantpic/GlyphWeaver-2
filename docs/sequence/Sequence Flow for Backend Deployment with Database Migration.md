# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Backend Deployment with Database Migration
  An operational diagram showing the automated process of deploying a new version of the backend services, including the critical step of running database migration scripts to update the schema.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To model the CI/CD process, ensuring safe, zero-downtime deployments and data integrity.

  #### .5. Type
  ServiceInteraction

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-GLYPH-CICD-PIPELINES
  - REPO-GLYPH-DB-MIGRATIONS
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Developer merges code into the main branch, triggering the pipeline in REPO-GLYPH-CICD-PIPELINES.
  - Pipeline builds and tests the backend application artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
  - Before deploying the new application, the pipeline executes the migration runner from REPO-GLYPH-DB-MIGRATIONS.
  - The migration runner connects to the production database and applies any new, unapplied migration scripts sequentially.
  - Once migrations are successful, the pipeline proceeds to deploy the new application version (e.g., rolling update).
  - Post-deployment smoke tests are run to verify service health.
