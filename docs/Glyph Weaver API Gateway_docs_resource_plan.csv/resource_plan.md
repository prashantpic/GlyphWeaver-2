TASK-101-1,"Initialize npm and define project metadata in package.json",Backend Development,,Low,3,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Backend developer with Node.js/npm experience.",Could use a pre-built project template or boilerplate to accelerate this step.
TASK-101-2,"Implement npm scripts for build, start, and dev workflows",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,1,Mid,1,"TASK-101-1,TASK-102-1",Yes,"Backend developer familiar with npm scripts and build tools like tsc and nodemon.",Use a more integrated build toolchain like webpack or vite, though likely overkill for a simple API gateway.

TASK-103-3,"Add startup validation logic to config loader",Backend Development,,Low,2.2,Mid,1,TASK-103-2,Yes,"Requires careful logic to ensure all required variables are checked before the app proceeds.",Defer validation to the point of use for each variable, but startup validation is safer to prevent runtime errors.
TASK-103-4,"Write unit tests for config validation",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Low,2.2,Mid,1,TASK-103-3,No,"QA or Backend developer with experience in a testing framework like Jest and mocking `process.env`.",Manual testing during development, but automated tests are essential for ensuring this critical piece works.
TASK-104-1,"Implement Winston logger in src/utils/logger.ts",Backend Development,,Low,3,Mid,1,TASK-103-2,Yes,"Backend developer with experience in structured logging libraries like Winston or pino.",Rely on simple `console.log` for development, but a structured logger is crucial for production monitoring.
TASK-104-2,"Write unit tests for logger configuration",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Low,2,Mid,1,TASK-104-1,No,"QA or Backend developer to verify logger behavior under different environment conditions.",Skip unit testing and rely on manual verification, which is less reliable.

TASK-401-1,"Spike/Research 'jose' library for JWKS verification",Backend Development,,Medium,6,Senior,1,"",Yes,"A senior developer should perform this research due to the security-critical nature of the task.",Choose a different JWT library without research, which carries the risk of selecting a poorly maintained or less secure option.

TASK-401-3,"Add robust error handling and payload attachment to auth middleware",Backend Development,,Medium,5.2,Senior,1,TASK-401-2,Yes,"Senior developer must handle all failure modes (expired, invalid, network error) correctly.",Generic error handling could leak security details or provide poor user feedback.
TASK-401-4,"Write comprehensive unit tests for auth middleware",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,High,12,Senior,1,TASK-401-3,No,"A senior QA or developer is needed to write exhaustive tests for this critical security component.",Insufficient testing, which could miss a major security vulnerability.

TASK-301-1,"Spike/Research express-http-proxy for custom decorators",Backend Development,,Medium,4,Mid,1,"",Yes,"A mid-level developer can research the library's capabilities for header and path manipulation.",Choose the library without a spike, which may lead to discovering limitations late in the development cycle.
TASK-301-2,"Implement proxy middleware factory in src/middleware/proxy.middleware.ts",Backend Development,,High,6.3,Mid,1,TASK-301-1,Yes,"Mid-level developer to implement the core proxying logic.

TASK-501-2,"Integrate Swagger UI into app.ts",Backend Development,Documentation,Low,2.5,Mid,1,"TASK-202-1,TASK-501-1",No,"Straightforward integration task for a mid-level developer.",Host the Swagger UI as a separate static site, which adds operational complexity.
TASK-502-1,"Add JSDoc annotations to public routes",Documentation,Backend Development,Low,3,Junior,1,"TASK-302-1,TASK-501-2",No,"Junior or Mid-level developer can handle this. Requires attention to detail.",No inline documentation, making the auto-generated spec empty and useless.
TASK-502-2,"Add JSDoc annotations to protected routes",Documentation,Backend Development,High,8,Mid,1,TASK-502-1,No,"Mid-level developer. More complex as it involves documenting security schemes for each protected route.",No inline documentation, leading to an incomplete and misleading API specification.
TASK-601-1,"Create .dockerignore file",DevOps,,Low,1,Mid,1,"",No,"A DevOps engineer or a backend developer with Docker knowledge can do this.",Not having a `.dockerignore` file, which leads to bloated and potentially insecure Docker images.

TASK-601-3,"Document Docker build and run commands",Documentation,DevOps,Low,2.5,Junior,1,TASK-601-2,No,"Junior developer or tech writer. Clear instructions are crucial for other developers and ops.",No documentation, forcing every user to re-discover the correct commands to build and run the service.
TASK-602-1,"Add /healthz endpoint to app.ts",DevOps,Backend Development,Low,1.5,Mid,1,TASK-202-1,No,"Mid-level developer. The endpoint must be placed before any auth or complex middleware.",No health check, which prevents container orchestrators like Kubernetes from effectively managing the application's lifecycle.
TASK-602-2,"Write integration test for /healthz endpoint",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Low,1.7,Mid,1,TASK-602-1,No,"QA or Backend developer to ensure the health check is always available and correct.",Manual testing, which is insufficient for a critical operational endpoint.
