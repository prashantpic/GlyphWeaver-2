"US-033","Quality Assurance and Testing","Implement Integration Tests for API Endpoints","QA Engineer","As a QA Engineer, I want to write integration tests for all API endpoints so that I can verify that all layers of the application (router, controller, service, repository) work together correctly.","Should Have",13,"US-031, US-014, US-020, US-025, US-030","Given an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/player/me`), When its integration test is run, Then it makes a real HTTP request to the application, and verifies the HTTP status code and response body are correct for a successful request.","Given an API endpoint, When its integration tests are run, Then scenarios for client errors (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 400 Bad Request due to validation) are tested and verified.","Given an integration test requires data to exist, When the test is set up, Then it seeds a test database with the required data before making the HTTP request and cleans up after itself.","WI-6013","Integration test files (`*.router.test.ts`) are created for all routers using Supertest. The tests cover the full request-response cycle, including authentication and validation. The test suite can be run against a live test server and database. The tests are added to the CI pipeline."
"US-034","Deployment and Operations","Containerize the Application for Deployment","DevOps Engineer","As a DevOps Engineer, I want to create a Dockerfile for the application so that I can build a portable, lightweight, and secure container image for consistent deployments in any environment.","Should Have",5,"US-001","Given the `Dockerfile` is in the repository root, When the `docker build .` command is run, Then a Docker image is created successfully without errors.","Given the Docker image is built, When a container is run from the image, Then the application starts up correctly and is accessible on the exposed port.","Given the `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build, When the final image is inspected, Then it does not contain development dependencies or source code, only the compiled JavaScript and production dependencies.","WI-7011","A multi-stage `Dockerfile` and a `.dockerignore` file are created and peer-reviewed. The resulting image is tested to ensure the application runs correctly. The image is built using a non-root user for security. Code is merged to the main branch."
"US-035","Deployment and Operations","Implement Structured, Environment-Aware Logging","DevOps Engineer","As a DevOps Engineer, I want the application to produce structured (JSON) logs in production so that I can easily ingest, parse, and search logs with an external monitoring service.","Should Have",5,"US-008","Given the application is running in a 'production' environment, When it logs a message, Then the output is a single-line JSON object containing a timestamp, log level, and message.","Given the application is running in a 'development' environment, When it logs a message, Then the output is a human-readable, color-coded format in the console.","Given an unhandled error is caught by the global error handler, When it is logged, Then the log entry includes the full stack trace for debugging purposes.","WI-7012","A centralized logger module using Winston is implemented. It is configured to use different formats based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. The logger is integrated into the error handler and used for informational logging throughout the app. Code is peer-reviewed and merged."
"US-036","Deployment and Operations","Automate Build and Test with a CI Pipeline","Developer","As a Developer, I want a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that automatically builds and tests the code on every push so that I can get fast feedback on code quality and prevent broken code from being merged.","Should Have",8,"US-033, US-034","Given a developer pushes a change to a branch, When the CI pipeline is triggered, Then it automatically installs dependencies, lints the code, runs the build, and executes all automated tests.","Given any step in the CI pipeline (e.g., a unit test) fails, When the pipeline runs, Then the entire pipeline is marked as failed, and the developer is notified.","Given all steps in the CI pipeline pass, When the pipeline runs, Then it is marked as successful, and a report is available showing the successful completion of all stages.","WI-7013","A CI configuration file (e.g., for GitHub Actions) is created in the repository. The pipeline is defined with sequential jobs for linting, building, and testing. The pipeline is tested and verified to trigger correctly on pushes. The configuration is merged to the main branch."
