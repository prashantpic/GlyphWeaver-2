WI-101,"Define project metadata and dependencies in package.json",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,2.67,Junior,1,"",Yes,"Requires careful selection of dependency versions using semantic versioning (e.g., '^'). The package name must be correctly scoped as it's a private package.","Use `npm init -y` as a starting point and manually edit. For larger projects, a generator like Yeoman could be used."
WI-102,"Create and configure tsconfig.json",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,2.0,Junior,1,WI-101,Yes,"Enabling `declaration: true` is critical for this library to be consumable by other TypeScript projects. `strict: true` enforces best practices.","Start with a base config from a template like `@tsconfig/node20/tsconfig.json` and extend it."
WI-103,"Define `build` script and verify compilation",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,2.34,Junior,1,WI-102,Yes,"This task serves as a smoke test for the initial project and TS configuration. A simple `src/index.ts` with an export is sufficient.","Combine this with the `tsconfig.json` setup task for a single validation step."
WI-201,"Implement Winston Logger utility with environment-specific formats",Backend Development,Infrastructure,Medium,3.17,Mid,1,WI-101,Yes,"The singleton pattern is important here. The logic must safely check `process.env.NODE_ENV`. Consider the performance implications of different transports.","Use a simpler logger like `pino` for higher performance, but Winston is more feature-rich and configurable."
WI-301,"Implement abstract ApiError base class",Backend Development,API,Low,1.67,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Correctly handling the prototype chain with `Object.setPrototypeOf` is key for `instanceof` checks to work reliably. This is a core architectural piece.","Use a simple interface instead of an abstract class, but the class approach allows for shared constructor logic and `instanceof` checks."
WI-302,"Implement concrete BadRequestError and NotFoundError classes",Backend Development,API,Low,1.83,Junior,1,WI-301,Yes,"Straightforward implementation extending the base class. Focus on providing clear, default messages.","A single factory function could generate these error classes, but individual classes are more explicit and discoverable."
WI-402,"Implement generic PagedResult DTO",Backend Development,API,Low,2.0,Mid,1,"",No,"Using `<T>` for generics is crucial for type safety in consuming services. Ensure the `totalPages` calculation handles edge cases like `totalCount = 0`.","Use a simple interface, but a class provides a constructor for convenient instantiation and can include methods if needed later."
WI-501,"Set up Jest and ts-jest configuration",Quality Assurance,DevOps,Medium,3.0,Mid,1,WI-101,Yes,"Ensure the `jest.config.js` correctly sets up the `ts-jest` preset and handles module mapping if necessary. This is a blocker for all testing.","Use another test runner like `vitest`, which often requires less configuration for TypeScript projects."
WI-502-1,"Write unit tests for Error Framework classes",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,3.0,Junior,1,"WI-302,WI-501",No,"Tests should be simple and verify the `statusCode` and the structure of the `serializeErrors()` output for each concrete error class.","Use snapshot testing to capture the serialized error output, but this can be brittle if messages change often."
WI-502-2,"Write unit tests for PagedResult DTO",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,2.67,Junior,1,"WI-402,WI-501",No,"Crucial to test the `totalPages` calculation with edge cases: 0 items, items < pageSize, items = pageSize, items > pageSize.","Parameterized tests could be used to efficiently cover multiple calculation scenarios."
WI-503-1,"Write integration tests for the Logger utility",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,High,4.34,Mid,1,"WI-201,WI-501",No,"Requires mocking/spying on `process.env` and `console`. Requires careful test setup and teardown to restore mocks, ensuring tests do not interfere with each other.","Write logs to a temporary stream/file and read it back, which is a truer integration test but more complex to set up."
WI-202,"Implement Mongoose DB connection utility",Backend Development,Database,Medium,3.5,Mid,1,"WI-201,WI-101",Yes,"Idempotency is key. A simple boolean flag (`isConnected`) is sufficient to prevent multiple connection attempts. Log all connection lifecycle events (`connected`, `error`, `disconnected`).","Could be implemented as a class to encapsulate connection state, but a simple function is often sufficient for this use case."
WI-303,"Implement errorHandler Express middleware",Backend Development,API,Medium,3.67,Mid,1,"WI-201,WI-302",Yes,"The middleware must have 4 arguments `(err, req, res, next)` for Express to recognize it as an error handler. Ensure generic errors are logged but not exposed to the client.","Not many alternatives for a global Express error handler. The logic could be simplified by not having a base class, but that would lead to less consistent error objects."
WI-401,"Implement Base Mongoose Schema Definition",Backend Development,Database,Low,2.0,Mid,1,WI-101,No,"Crucially, this exports a `SchemaDefinition` object, not a compiled `Schema`. This allows consumers to merge it into their own schemas. TSDoc is important for explaining the `timestamps` option.","A Mongoose plugin could achieve the same result, but a simple definition object is easier to understand and use."
WI-503-2,"Write integration tests for the DbConnection utility",Quality Assurance,Database,Very High,8.67,Senior,1,"WI-202,WI-501",No,"This is a complex test. Requires managing the lifecycle of `mongodb-memory-server` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll` hooks. Tests must cover success, failure (missing URI), and idempotency.","Use Docker to spin up a real MongoDB container for testing. This is a more realistic test but slower and requires Docker to be installed on the CI runner."
WI-504,"Implement main entrypoint (barrel file) in src/index.ts",Backend Development,Architecture,Low,2.0,Junior,1,"WI-201,WI-202,WI-302,WI-303,WI-401,WI-402",Yes,"This file is critical for the public API of the package. It should only contain `export * from '...'` statements. This is the final step to make the library usable.","Consumers could import directly from file paths, but this is brittle and exposes the internal file structure."
WI-505,"Create project README.md with usage examples",Product Management,"Technical Writing, Backend Development",High,5.0,Mid,1,WI-504,Yes,"Examples should be copy-pasteable and cover the most common use cases. Explain the 'why' behind the design. Must include environment variable requirements. A library without docs is unusable.","Generate documentation from TSDoc comments using a tool like TypeDoc, but a handwritten README is usually more user-friendly for a top-level overview."
