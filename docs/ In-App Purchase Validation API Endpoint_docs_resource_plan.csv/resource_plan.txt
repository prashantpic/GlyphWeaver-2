Requires a definitive list of production and development dependencies. A Junior dev is suitable for this task.","Use a pre-existing project boilerplate or a scaffolding tool (e.g., Yeoman, NestJS CLI) and then customize dependencies."
TASK-IAP-002-01,"Create and configure tsconfig.json",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,3.7,Junior,1,"TASK-IAP-001-01",Yes,"Requires knowledge of TypeScript compiler options. A template from a similar project can be used. A Junior dev with some TS experience can handle this.","Start with a very basic tsconfig.json and add stricter rules incrementally as the codebase grows, rather than starting with all rules enabled."
TASK-IAP-003-01,"Implement environment variable loader and create example file",Backend Development,DevOps,Medium,4.5,Junior,1,"TASK-IAP-001-01",Yes,"Security-sensitive task. Developer must ensure `.env` is correctly added to `.gitignore`. Requires knowledge of `dotenv` library.","Use a dedicated configuration management library like `config` or `convict` which provides more structure and validation than `dotenv` alone."
TASK-IAP-004-01,"Implement basic Mongoose connection logic",Backend Development,Database,Medium,4.2,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-003-01",Yes,"Core infrastructure task. Requires Mongoose and MongoDB knowledge. A Mid-level developer is preferred to ensure proper error handling from the start.","Wrap the connection logic in a singleton class to ensure only one connection pool is created throughout the application's lifecycle."
TASK-IAP-004-02,"Implement robust connection event handling and retry logic",Backend Development,Database,Medium,6,Senior,1,"TASK-IAP-004-01",Yes,"Complex task requiring deep understanding of Mongoose event loops and error handling for resilience. Senior developer recommended to implement robust exponential backoff.","Instead of custom logic, use a managed database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) that handles connection pooling and provides a more resilient connection string."
TASK-IAP-010-01,"Implement IAPTransaction Mongoose schema and model",Backend Development,Database,Medium,7,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-004-01",Yes,"Security-critical task due to the unique index for replay attack prevention. Requires careful implementation.

A Mid-level developer with an eye for good architecture is suitable.","Use a simple conditional (if/else) block inside the main service instead of a formal Factory pattern, which is simpler but less extensible if more platforms are added."
TASK-IAP-030-01,"Scaffold IapValidationService and inject dependencies",Backend Development,API,Low,3,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-020-01,TASK-IAP-011-01,TASK-IAP-012-01,TASK-IAP-013-02",Yes,"Architectural setup task. Requires understanding of dependency injection. A Mid-level developer should set this up to ensure a clean structure.","Use a DI container framework like InversifyJS or NestJS to manage dependencies automatically, rather than manual injection in the service's constructor."
TASK-IAP-030-02,"Implement service logic for the happy path",Backend Development,API,High,8.3,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-030-01",Yes,"This is the core business logic orchestration.

TASK-IAP-030-04,"Implement robust try-catch for fulfillment failure",Backend Development,Database,High,10.7,Senior,1,"TASK-IAP-030-02",Yes,"Complex error handling and state management to prevent data inconsistency. A Senior developer is needed to handle the different failure modes correctly.","Implement a Saga pattern using a message queue. Each step (validate, grant, log) is a separate transaction, and failures trigger compensating transactions to roll back the state."
TASK-IAP-040-01,"Define ValidateIap DTOs",Backend Development,API,Low,2,Junior,1,"",No,"Simple data structure definition using TypeScript interfaces or classes. A Junior developer can easily handle this based on the SDS.","Use a schema definition language like JSON Schema or Zod to define the DTOs, which can then be used to auto-generate TypeScript types and validators."
TASK-IAP-041-01,"Implement Joi validation schema with conditional logic",Backend Development,API,Medium,5.2,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-040-01",No,"Requires knowledge of the Joi library, specifically the complex `when()` conditional logic. A Mid-level developer is appropriate for this task.","Perform validation inside the controller using simple if/else statements instead of a dedicated library.

A Junior developer with Jest experience is suitable.","Manually test the validator using an API client like Postman or Insomnia instead of writing automated unit tests, which is faster initially but not repeatable."
TASK-IAP-042-01,"Implement IapController",Backend Development,API,Medium,6,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-030-01",No,"Standard Express.js controller implementation. Requires connecting the HTTP layer to the service layer. A Mid-level developer can handle this.","Combine the controller and routing logic into a single file for simpler, smaller features, though this is less scalable and violates separation of concerns."
TASK-IAP-043-01,"Configure IAP Express router and middleware pipeline",Backend Development,API,Medium,6.3,Mid,1,"TASK-IAP-041-01,TASK-IAP-042-01",Yes,"Security-sensitive configuration. The order of middleware (auth, validation, controller) is critical. A Mid-level dev should implement, and another should review.","Define the entire route and its handler logic directly in the main `app.ts` file, avoiding a separate router file. This is not recommended for larger applications."
TASK-IAP-043-02,"Integrate IAP router into main Express app",Backend Development,API,Low,2,Junior,1,"TASK-IAP-043-01",Yes,"Simple one-line change in the main application file to mount the router. A Junior developer can handle this.","",""

A Mid-level developer with strong Jest and Mongoose knowledge is required.","Skip unit tests for repositories and rely solely on integration tests that hit a real database. This verifies behavior but makes it harder to pinpoint failures."
TASK-IAP-050-02,"Unit test IapValidationService",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,High,16,Senior,1,"TASK-IAP-030-04",Yes,"The most complex unit testing task, involving mocking multiple dependencies and testing complex orchestration logic, including success and failure paths. A Senior dev is ideal.","Write a single, large integration test instead of multiple unit tests. This is easier to write but much harder to debug when it fails."
TASK-IAP-050-03,"Unit test PlatformGatewayFactory",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Low,3,Junior,1,"TASK-IAP-020-01",No,"Simple test to verify that the factory returns the correct object based on input.
