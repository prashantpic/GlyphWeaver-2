// This prefab visually represents one connection (segment) between two cells in a path.
// It might use a SpriteRenderer (for a line/styled segment) or a LineRenderer component.
// A PathSegmentView C# script could be attached to manage its appearance (e.g., color for valid/invalid states)
// and orientation between cells in the Unity Editor. Instantiated by PathRenderer.
