// No C# code is generated directly for .prefab files in this text format.
// This prefab is similar to GlyphView.prefab but specialized for Catalyst glyphs.
// It would include distinct visuals, possibly an integrated timer display (e.g., a radial fill Image),
// and particle effects for activation or expiry.
// A CatalystGlyphView C# script (which might inherit from a base GlyphView or be distinct)
// would be attached to manage its specific behaviors and visuals in the Unity Editor.
