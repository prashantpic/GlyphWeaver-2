// No C# code is generated directly for .prefab files in this text format.
// This prefab represents one cell in the game grid. It might contain an Image or SpriteRenderer
// for its background, and potentially child GameObjects for highlighting or other visual effects.
// A GridCellView C# script (if complex behavior is needed per cell beyond simple visuals)
// could be attached in the Unity Editor. It's primarily instantiated by GridRenderer.
