// No C# code is generated directly for .prefab files in this text format.
// This prefab is the visual representation of a game glyph. It would contain
// SpriteRenderers or Images to display the glyph's symbol, color, and accessibility pattern.
// It might also include ParticleSystem components for effects.
// A GlyphView C# script would be attached to manage its visual state and interactions,
// linking it to a GlyphData model in the Unity Editor.
