    Unity manages dependencies primarily through:
    1. Assembly Definition (.asmdef) files for inter-project dependencies.
    2. Unity Package Manager for external packages (e.g., Unity.Localization, TextMeshPro).
    3. Direct .dll references (less common for organized projects).

    This .csproj is illustrative. In a real Unity project, you wouldn't typically edit this file directly
    for the code within the Assets folder. Unity generates its solution (.sln) and C# project (.csproj)
    files based on the .asmdef files and package configurations.

    The dependencies listed in the .asmdef files (GlyphPuzzle.UI.Components, Unity.Localization,
    DOTween.Modules, Unity.TextMeshPro) would be resolved by Unity's build system.
